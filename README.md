 ## Title: 
 
Employee Payroll Challenge
  
 ## Description: 

In this project, there are 3 new functions added to the provided starter code. The first function, collectEmployees =, creates an empty array where data from user input will be stored. These inputs come from pop up promps that the user will see. The first name, last name and salary of an emplyee is stored as an object within the array. Then the user is asked to continue for creating an another emplyee. 
The second function defines the total salary as zero, then adds all individual salaries to it. The average salary is then found by dividing the new total salary by the total amount of employees. This number is the console logged.
The final function uses math.random to randomly select an emplyee from the array. The math.random fucntion is defined as 'index' and is combined with the employees array for a random search within that array. The answer is the first and last name of a random employee. This is console logged when completed.
